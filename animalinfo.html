                            <div class="mt-4 ml-3">1. Hippos are considered the second largest land animal on Earth. Males measure around 3.5m long and 1.5m tall, and can weigh up 3,200kg.</div>
                            <div class="mt-4 ml-3">2. Hippos are most active at night, when they forage for food. They are herbivores, and eat mostly grass –
                              and boy do they eat grass! In just one night, they can guzzle down up to 35kg of their favourite grub!.</div>

                             <div class="mt-4 ml-3">1. A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe and a male is called a buck.</div>
                             <div class="mt-4 ml-3">2. Rabbits are very social creatures that live in groups. They live in warrens — a series of tunnels and rooms that they dig underground.</div>
                             <div class="mt-4 ml-3">3. Rabbits’ eyes are on the sides of their head, meaning they can see almost all the way around them.</div>
                             <div class="mt-4 ml-3">4. Rabbits are amazing athletes — they can jump as high as 90 centimetres in one leap!.</div>
                             <div class="mt-4 ml-3">5. One of the world’s best-known rabbits is the Warner Bros cartoon character,
                               Bugs Bunny — who’s often seen munching on a carrot! In fact, carrots aren’t a natural part of a rabbit’s diet
                               and can give bunnies an upset stomach if they eat too many.</div>

                              <div class="mt-4 ml-3">1. Our planet is home to three different species of zebra, the plains zebra, Grevy’s zebra and mountain zebra, all three species are native to Africa.</div>
                              <div class="mt-4 ml-3">2. Closely related to horses, zebras have thick bodies, thin legs, a tufted tail,
                                and a long head and neck sporting a short mane. And their most famous feature? Their brilliant black-and-white striped coat, of course!</div>
                              <div class="mt-4 ml-3">3. So why do zebras have stripes? Well, scientists aren’t entirely sure. Their stripes perhaps serve to dazzle
                                and confuse predators and biting insects, or to control the animal’s body heat. Because each individual’s stripes are unique,
                                their stripes may also have a social purpose, helping zebras to recognise one other.</div>
                              <div class="mt-4 ml-3">4. A group of zebras is called a Dazzle.</div>
                              <div class="mt-4 ml-3">5. Zebra can travel long distances. Zebras are black animals with white strips.</div>
